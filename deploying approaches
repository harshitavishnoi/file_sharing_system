Use load balancing for distributing traffic.

7. Automated Deployment:
Use tools like Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

8. Backup and Recovery:
Implementing regular backups of database and application files.
Have a recovery plan in case of failures.

9. Documentation:
Document the deployment process, configurations, and any specific details related to production environment.
Testing in Staging:

Before deploying to production, test the application in a staging environment that mimics the production setup.
